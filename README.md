# 🧠 Machine Learning Assignments (DD1420)

This repository contains my completed **assignments and exercises** for **DD1420 – Foundations of Machine Learning**. Each section corresponds to a key topic in machine learning, following the structure of the official course notes. The assignments span a wide range of theoretical and practical aspects, from optimization and generalization to neural networks, probability, and data generation.
